# An Analysis of Crime in San Francisco and Baltimore

## Goal

Sports Fans LLC has the goal of opening at least one location in every city with a major sports team. While they are opening up multiple stores this year, their team has some concerns about the stores that will be opening up in San Francisco and Baltimore as those cities have been making headlines for rampant crime as of late. The goal of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of crimes within both cities that identifies trends and patterns so that the company can make an informed decision when deciding on a location within the cities. 

## Approach

- Collect Data
    - SF Crime dataset: [SF Crime](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783)
        - Documentation on dataset (includes description of dataset as well as relevant terminology): [SF Crime Documentation](https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/sfpd-incident-report-2018-to-present)
    - Baltimore Dataset: [Baltimore Crime](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/baltimore::part-1-crime-data/about)
- Clean Data
- Create Database
- Visualize data
- Create models to predict trends

## Relevant Information

While the data sets used were very similar, there were some key differences. The Baltimore data set only included major crimes, while the San Francisco data set included all reported incidents. The San Francisco data set only contained information from 2018-present while the Baltimore data set included information from the 2000s to present. For the sake of consistency, visuals have been filtered to include data only from 2018 onward for both sets. Additionally, most visuals focus on the top 10 crime categories per city that would be relevant to a retail store. These modifications exclude unnecessary information in order to proide more precise insight.
